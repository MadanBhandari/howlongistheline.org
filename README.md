Problem: there are long lines for the supermarket during lockdown

## How to send a pull request
Please see http://socialarchitecture.science/c4/ for the full contribution protocol, but this can essentially be summarised as:

- There is no intended direction for this project other than to solve problems. 
- If your pull request is the simplest solution to a clearly stated problem, it will be merged without any value judgment from the maintainers. There's no difference between patching a bug and adding a new feature, they are all just solutions to problems. 
- It's a good idea to post the problem on the issue tracker to seek consensus on the observed problem.
- If you start working on something in the issue tracker, let people know with a comment so that someone else doesn't do the same thing.
- Send all pull requests straight to master, this then gets pulled straight into production. It sounds scary, but if you read http://socialarchitecture.science/c4-deep/ you'll see why this works out very nicely.
